# alittleteapot.im

alittleteapot.im is a "beautifully" animated teapot, made with CSS animations. 
Really it was a placeholder for a fun domain name. If I were to make a Java package called `ShortAndStout`, the package name could be `Im.ALittleTeapot.ShortAndStout`.

To get the lettering just right, it uses [animate.css](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/), [lettering.js]()http://letteringjs.com/, and [textillate.js](http://textillate.js.org/).

The domain has since expired.
